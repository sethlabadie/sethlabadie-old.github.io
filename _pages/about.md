Hi! Iâ€™m Seth, a Data Scientist for the DoD and the Intelligence Community. I have a diverse set of experiences. I am a career military officer (Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve) in the Intelligence field, with work at the Pentagon and with Special Operations. When not on Active Duty, I am a contractor as a Data Scientist for the same set of organizations. Previously, I also worked in finance and accounting.I started in Data Analytics in 2001, and stepped into Data Science in 2015.

I continue to self-study everything I can about Python, visualization, databases, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. Although I already have two Masters degrees, I am currently taking classes in Cloud Computing at a local community college. I intend to continue formal education in Data Science, either at the Masters or PhD level.

I am interested in the intersection of Data Science and Intelligence, and how the two can be used to better inform decision makers. I am also interested in the ethical implications of Data Science and how to ensure that Data Science is used for good.

## My work and research
I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to investigate intelligence problems, improve them, and build tools to help analysis. Most of my work is in the areas of intelligence analysis, data science, and data-intensive social science. Most of my work is on private networks, but I also conduct personal projects, some of which I post on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/sethlabadie) account.

I am an interdisciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like Data Science, computer science, information science, international relations, security studies, economics, organization/management science, decision analysis, and intelligence studies. My background is in international relations, security studies, finance, and intelligence, but most of my recent experience is in Data Science. I expect to continue blending these disciplines in my future work.

## My background and history
I received an MSSI (Strategic Intelligence) from the [National Intelligence University](https://www.ni-u.edu), an MSA (Accountancy) from [San Jose State University](https://www.sjsu.edu), and a BA (Political Science / International Relations) from the [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu). I am currently studying Cloud Computing at [Northern Virginia Community College](https://www.nvcc.edu) to increase my technical knowledge.
